# README Generator
  [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT%20License-green)](#license)

  ## Description

  This project creates a README.md with the user input provided. I build this to create an easier and streamlined way of creating READMEs for my future prrojects. It works by having the inquirer npm prompt the user for all the necessary information and then inputs the data into a template-literal. That template is then written into an actual file into the dist directory using the fs.write method in node.js.
